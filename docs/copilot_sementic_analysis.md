# 🧠 Semantic Analysis Feature Plan for MCP Evaluation System

## Current Evaluation Workflow
```
Agent -> Hook -> Database -> Post-processing -> Results
```

## Proposed Enhanced Workflow
```
Agent -> Hook -> Database -> Post-processing -> Results -> Semantic Analysis -> Enhanced Insights
```

## 🎯 Semantic Analysis Overview

### Purpose
Enhance the MCP evaluation system with intelligent analysis capabilities that can:
- **Distinguish between actual failures and false negatives** (task completed but marked as failed)
- **Identify partial successes** (correct approach but incomplete execution)
- **Evaluate response quality and relevance** beyond simple success/failure metrics
- **Detect tool usage effectiveness** and appropriateness
- **Provide actionable insights** for prompt and system improvements

### Core Concept
Use Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities to perform semantic analysis on evaluation results, providing a second-layer evaluation that goes beyond mechanical success detection.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### 1. Semantic Analysis Engine

```python
class SemanticAnalysisEngine:
    """
    Intelligent post-evaluation analysis using Claude for semantic understanding.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, claude_model="sonnet"):
        self.claude_model = claude_model
        self.analysis_client = None  # Separate Claude client for analysis
        
    def analyze_session_results(self, session_metrics: EvaluationMetrics, 
                              session_data: MonitoringSession) -> SemanticAnalysis:
        """
        Perform comprehensive semantic analysis of a single evaluation session.
        """
        
    def analyze_comparative_results(self, claude_result: EvaluationMetrics, 
                                  opencode_result: EvaluationMetrics) -> ComparativeAnalysis:
        """
        Compare and analyze results between Claude and OpenCode agents.
        """
        
    def analyze_batch_results(self, results: List[EvaluationMetrics]) -> BatchAnalysis:
        """
        Analyze patterns across multiple evaluation sessions.
        """
```
